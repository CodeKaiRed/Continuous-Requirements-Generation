## System Instructions
A software requirements specification is a document containing specifications for a piece of software. It covers the following areas, as specified in bullets:
- Version History
- System Purpose or Objective
- System Description
- Stakeholders or User Classes
- Constraints
- Naming Conventions
- Glossary of Terms
- Assumptions
- Functional Requirements
- Nonfunctional Requirements
- Design Constraints
- Use Cases

A use case highlights the flow of the application to accomplish a goal. The use case format is as follows in bullets:
- Goal
- Actors
- Preconditions
- Triggers
- Basic Scenario (Numbered Sequence for Event Flow)
- Alternative Scenario
- Postconditions

Functional requirements outline what the system will do, while non-functional requirements describe implementation details related to the systemâ€™s functional requirements such as performance, security, safety, reliability, availability, modularity, legality, maintability, portability, supportability, scalability, and/or usability. High-level requirements outline main functionality or a big feature. Low-level requirements outline a set of unique detailed requirements needed to comprehensively realize the high-level requirement it's associated with. All requirements should have a unique numbering system.

A comprehensive set of requirements will extend past the perspective of the software product, user, or stakeholder. A collection (aggregate) of requirements or individual requirements must always meet the following definitions to be achievable, clear, complete, concise, correct, consistent, necessary, organized, unambiguous, and understandable:
- A requirement or an aggregate is achievable/feasible/attainable if and only if there exists at least one system design and implementation that correctly implements the requirement or all the requirements stated in the aggregate at a definable cost. 
- A requirement or an aggregate is clear/precise/meaningful if and only if (a) numeric quantities are used whenever possible, and (b) the appropriate levels of precision are used for all numeric quantities.
- A requirement is complete if it is capable of standing alone when separated from other requirements and does not need further amplification. An aggregate of requirements is complete if and only if (a) It includes all significant requirements, whether relating to functionality, performance, design constraints, attributes, or external interfaces. 
- A requirement or an aggregate is concise if it is as short as possible without adversely affecting any other quality. 
- A requirement is correct if it accurately describes a functionality to be delivered. An aggregate is correct if and only if every requirement stated therein is one that the software shall meet. 
- An aggregate is internally consistent if and only if no subset of individual requirements stated in it conflict. An aggregate is modifiable if and only if its structure and style are such that any changes to the requirements can be made easily, completely, and consistently while retaining the structure and style. 
- A requirement is necessary if the stated requirement is an essential capability, physical characteristic, or quality factor of the product or process. If it is removed or deleted, a deficiency will exist, which cannot be fulfilled by other capabilities of the product or process. 
- An aggregate is organized if and only if its contents are arranged so that readers can easily locate information and logical relationships among adjacent sections are apparent. - A requirement is prioritized/ranked/annotated by relative importance if the requirement is assigned an implementation priority to indicate how essential it is to include it in a particular product. 
- An aggregate is prioritized/ranked/annotated by relative importance if each requirement in it has an identifier to indicate the importance of that particular requirement. 
- A requirement or an aggregate is unambiguous if different readers with similar backgrounds would be able to draw only one interpretation of the requirement or of each requirement in the aggregate. 
- A requirement or an aggregate is understandable if all classes of readers can easily comprehend the meaning of the requirement or all requirements in the aggregate, with a minimum of explanation.

A user story defines an end goal of a software feature written from the perspective of the end user. Its purpose is to articulate how a software feature will provide value to the customer. User stories should be formatted as follows:
"As a a [type of user], I want to [complete some objective], so that I [receive some benefit]."

You are a helpful assistant that translates Pontis user stories into a set of requirement artifacts listed below:
- Functional requirements
- Non-functional requirements
- Use cases
- Operational scenarios
- Constraints

For each user story, create a new set of achievable, clear, complete, concise, correct, consistent, necessary, organized, unambiguous, and understandable requirement artifacts. For each requirement artifact, provide the line number of the output_srs.txt file where the artifact should be placed.

assistant > Based on the provided user story and the information extracted from the Pontis documentation, the following set of requirement artifacts can be crafted:

### Functional Requirements
1. **FR1:** The system shall provide capabilities for highway information analysts to access and visualize traffic data on the map display.
    - **Location in output_srs.txt:** Line 4.2 UC-4 Select and View Pontis Information Using Maps, Requirement 4.1 and 4.2 .

### Non-Functional Requirements
1. **NFR1:** The map display feature must update in real-time to provide the most current traffic data available.
    - **NFR2:** The system shall support the latest versions of major web browsers for the map display feature to ensure accessibility.
    - **NFR3:** Traffic data visualized on the map display must be secured to prevent unauthorized access or tampering.

### Use Cases
1. **Use Case - Visualizing Traffic Data on Map Display**
    - **Goal:** Enable highway information analysts to make informed decisions regarding traffic impacts on bridges by visualizing traffic data on the map display.
    - **Actors:** Highway information analysts.
    - **Preconditions:** User is authenticated and authorized to access the traffic data visualization feature.
    - **Triggers:** User selects the option to visualize traffic data on the map display.
    - **Basic Scenario:**
        1. User logs into the system.
        2. User navigates to the map display feature.
        3. System displays the map with current traffic data overlay.
        4. User interacts with the map to zoom, pan, or select specific regions for detailed traffic data.
        5. User reviews the traffic data to make decisions regarding traffic impacts on bridges.
    - **Alternative Scenario:** If current traffic data is not available, the system displays the most recent data and notifies the user.
    - **Postconditions:** Traffic data is visualized on the map, enabling the highway information analyst to assess traffic impacts on bridges.
    - **Location in output_srs.txt:** Line 3.0 Use Cases, Use Case 4: Select and View Pontis Information Using Maps .

### Constraints
- The system's ability to visualize traffic data on the map is dependent on the availability of traffic data from external data sources.
- The visualization of traffic data on the map must comply with data privacy and security regulations.

### Operational Scenarios
- During peak traffic hours, the system highlights areas with high traffic congestion on the map to aid in decision-making about bridge traffic management.

### Glossary of Terms
- **Traffic Data:** Information relating to the movement of vehicles on roads, including volumes, speeds, and congestion levels, used to assess the impact on bridge infrastructure.

This set of requirement artifacts, crafted from the user story provided, addresses the functionality for visualizing traffic data on a map display, which aims to enable highway information analysts to make better decisions regarding traffic impacts on bridges.
