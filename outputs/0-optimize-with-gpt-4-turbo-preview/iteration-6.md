# Observations
The inputs and model configuration are the exact same as iteration-5.md. The new requirements now have a "NEW" tag included in there ID. The formatting for the location of the additional requirement artifacts is slightly different. This would be make it harder to integrate with a downstream script in the pipeline that applies the changes consistently.

# Configuration
## RAG Files:
data/2005 - pontis.pdf
data/output_srs.md
data/IEEE 830-1998.pdf
## Model Name

## Prompt
    As a highway information analyst, 
    I want to see traffic data in the map display
    so that I can make better decisions for traffic impacts on bridges.

# System Instructions
A software requirements specification is a document containing specifications for a piece of software. It covers the following areas, as specified in bullets:
- Version History
- System Purpose or Objective
- System Description
- Stakeholders or User Classes
- Constraints
- Naming Conventions
- Glossary of Terms
- Assumptions
- Functional Requirements
- Nonfunctional Requirements
- Design Constraints
- Use Cases

A use case highlights the flow of the application to accomplish a goal. The use case format is as follows in bullets:
- Goal
- Actors
- Preconditions
- Triggers
- Basic Scenario (Numbered Sequence for Event Flow)
- Alternative Scenario
- Postconditions

Functional requirements outline what the system will do, while non-functional requirements describe implementation details related to the systemâ€™s functional requirements such as performance, security, safety, reliability, availability, modularity, legality, maintability, portability, supportability, scalability, and/or usability. High-level requirements outline main functionality or a big feature. Low-level requirements outline a set of unique detailed requirements needed to comprehensively realize the high-level requirement it's associated with. All requirements should have a unique numbering system.

A comprehensive set of requirements will extend past the perspective of the software product, user, or stakeholder. A collection (aggregate) of requirements or individual requirements must always meet the following definitions to be achievable, clear, complete, concise, correct, consistent, necessary, organized, unambiguous, and understandable:
- A requirement or an aggregate is achievable/feasible/attainable if and only if there exists at least one system design and implementation that correctly implements the requirement or all the requirements stated in the aggregate at a definable cost. 
- A requirement or an aggregate is clear/precise/meaningful if and only if (a) numeric quantities are used whenever possible, and (b) the appropriate levels of precision are used for all numeric quantities.
- A requirement is complete if it is capable of standing alone when separated from other requirements and does not need further amplification. An aggregate of requirements is complete if and only if (a) It includes all significant requirements, whether relating to functionality, performance, design constraints, attributes, or external interfaces. 
- A requirement or an aggregate is concise if it is as short as possible without adversely affecting any other quality. 
- A requirement is correct if it accurately describes a functionality to be delivered. An aggregate is correct if and only if every requirement stated therein is one that the software shall meet. 
- An aggregate is internally consistent if and only if no subset of individual requirements stated in it conflict. An aggregate is modifiable if and only if its structure and style are such that any changes to the requirements can be made easily, completely, and consistently while retaining the structure and style. 
- A requirement is necessary if the stated requirement is an essential capability, physical characteristic, or quality factor of the product or process. If it is removed or deleted, a deficiency will exist, which cannot be fulfilled by other capabilities of the product or process. 
- An aggregate is organized if and only if its contents are arranged so that readers can easily locate information and logical relationships among adjacent sections are apparent. - A requirement is prioritized/ranked/annotated by relative importance if the requirement is assigned an implementation priority to indicate how essential it is to include it in a particular product. 
- An aggregate is prioritized/ranked/annotated by relative importance if each requirement in it has an identifier to indicate the importance of that particular requirement. 
- A requirement or an aggregate is unambiguous if different readers with similar backgrounds would be able to draw only one interpretation of the requirement or of each requirement in the aggregate. 
- A requirement or an aggregate is understandable if all classes of readers can easily comprehend the meaning of the requirement or all requirements in the aggregate, with a minimum of explanation.
- A non-functional requirement should be quantifiable and testable. 

A user story defines an end goal of a software feature written from the perspective of the end user. Its purpose is to articulate how a software feature will provide value to the customer. User stories should be formatted as follows:
"As a a [type of user], I want to [complete some objective], so that I [receive some benefit]."

You are a helpful assistant that translates Pontis user stories into a set of requirement artifacts listed below:
- Functional requirements
- Non-functional requirements
- Use cases
- Operational scenarios
- Constraints

For each user story, create a new set of achievable, clear, complete, concise, correct, consistent, necessary, organized, unambiguous, and understandable requirement artifacts. There may be more than one artifact type created for each user story. For each requirement artifact, provide the line number of the output_srs.md file where the artifact should be placed.

# Final Output Message
Based on the user story provided, the following requirement artifacts have been formulated to be added to the Pontis documentation:

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-NEW1:** The system must provide real-time traffic data visualization on the map display. This includes traffic flow, congestion levels, and incidents affecting traffic on and around bridges.
  - *Location in document:* After line 1.8 in the Functional Requirements section .

### Non-functional Requirements
- **NFR-NEW1:** Traffic data visualization must be updated in real-time, with a maximum latency of 60 seconds from data acquisition to display.
  - *Location in document:* After the last non-functional requirement listed in the Non-functional Requirements section .

### Use Cases
- **UC-NEW1:** Display Traffic Data on Map
  - *Goal:* Provide users with the ability to view real-time traffic data on maps.
  - *Actors:* Highway information analysts.
  - *Preconditions:* User is authenticated and authorized to access traffic data.
  - *Triggers:* User requests to view traffic data on the map.
  - *Basic Scenario:*
    1. User opens the map display feature within the Pontis application.
    2. User selects the option to display traffic data.
    3. System fetches the latest available traffic data from the database.
    4. System updates the map display with current traffic conditions.
    5. User analyzes traffic data to make informed decisions regarding traffic impacts on bridges.
  - *Alternative Scenario:* If traffic data is not available, notify the user and suggest alternative sources or actions.
  - *Postconditions:* The map display reflects the most current traffic conditions available.
  - *Location in document:* After Use Case 24 in the Use Cases section  .

### Constraints
- **CONST-NEW1:** The traffic data integration must comply with existing data privacy and sharing policies applicable to the data source.
  - *Location in document:* After the last entry in the Project Constraints section .

These requirement artifacts align with the goal outlined in the user story for augmenting decision-making capabilities based on traffic impacts on bridges. Please ensure to insert these artifacts at the specified locations within the Pontis documentation to maintain the document's integrity and organization.
