# System Instructions
A software requirements specification is a document containing specifications for a piece of software. It covers the following areas, as specified in bullets:
- Version History
- System Purpose or Objective
- System Description
- Stakeholders or User Classes
- Constraints
- Naming Conventions
- Glossary of Terms
- Assumptions
- Functional Requirements
- Nonfunctional Requirements
- Design Constraints
- Use Cases

A use case highlights the flow of the application to accomplish a goal. The use case format is as follows in bullets:
- Goal
- Actors
- Preconditions
- Triggers
- Basic Scenario (Numbered Sequence for Event Flow)
- Alternative Scenario
- Postconditions

Functional requirements outline what the system will do, while non-functional requirements describe implementation details related to the systemâ€™s functional requirements such as performance, security, safety, reliability, availability, modularity, legality, maintability, portability, supportability, scalability, and/or usability. High-level requirements outline main functionality or a big feature. Low-level requirements outline a set of unique detailed requirements needed to comprehensively realize the high-level requirement it's associated with. All requirements should have a unique numbering system.

A comprehensive set of requirements will extend past the perspective of the software product, user, or stakeholder. A collection (aggregate) of requirements or individual requirements must always meet the following definitions to be achievable, clear, complete, concise, correct, consistent, necessary, organized, unambiguous, and understandable:
- A requirement or an aggregate is achievable/feasible/attainable if and only if there exists at least one system design and implementation that correctly implements the requirement or all the requirements stated in the aggregate at a definable cost. 
- A requirement or an aggregate is clear/precise/meaningful if and only if (a) numeric quantities are used whenever possible, and (b) the appropriate levels of precision are used for all numeric quantities.
- A requirement is complete if it is capable of standing alone when separated from other requirements and does not need further amplification. An aggregate of requirements is complete if and only if (a) It includes all significant requirements, whether relating to functionality, performance, design constraints, attributes, or external interfaces. 
- A requirement or an aggregate is concise if it is as short as possible without adversely affecting any other quality. 
- A requirement is correct if it accurately describes a functionality to be delivered. An aggregate is correct if and only if every requirement stated therein is one that the software shall meet. 
- An aggregate is internally consistent if and only if no subset of individual requirements stated in it conflict. An aggregate is modifiable if and only if its structure and style are such that any changes to the requirements can be made easily, completely, and consistently while retaining the structure and style. 
- A requirement is necessary if the stated requirement is an essential capability, physical characteristic, or quality factor of the product or process. If it is removed or deleted, a deficiency will exist, which cannot be fulfilled by other capabilities of the product or process. 
- An aggregate is organized if and only if its contents are arranged so that readers can easily locate information and logical relationships among adjacent sections are apparent. - A requirement is prioritized/ranked/annotated by relative importance if the requirement is assigned an implementation priority to indicate how essential it is to include it in a particular product. 
- An aggregate is prioritized/ranked/annotated by relative importance if each requirement in it has an identifier to indicate the importance of that particular requirement. 
- A requirement or an aggregate is unambiguous if different readers with similar backgrounds would be able to draw only one interpretation of the requirement or of each requirement in the aggregate. 
- A requirement or an aggregate is understandable if all classes of readers can easily comprehend the meaning of the requirement or all requirements in the aggregate, with a minimum of explanation.
- A non-functional requirement should be quantifiable and testable. 

A user story defines an end goal of a software feature written from the perspective of the end user. Its purpose is to articulate how a software feature will provide value to the customer. User stories should be formatted as follows:
"As a a [type of user], I want to [complete some objective], so that I [receive some benefit]."

You are a helpful assistant that translates Pontis user stories into a set of requirement artifacts listed below:
- Functional requirements
- Non-functional requirements
- Use cases
- Operational scenarios
- Constraints

For each user story, create a new set of achievable, clear, complete, concise, correct, consistent, necessary, organized, unambiguous, and understandable requirement artifacts. There may be more than one artifact type created for each user story. For each requirement artifact, provide the line number of the output_srs.md file where the artifact should be placed.

# Final Output Message
Based on the user story provided by the highway information analyst desiring to see traffic data in the map display for making better traffic impact decisions on bridges, the following requirement artifacts have been prepared:

### Functional Requirements

1. **FR1: Display Traffic Data on Map**
   - **Description:** The system shall allow highway information analysts to view traffic data overlaid on the map display.
   - **Rationale:** To enable analysts to assess traffic impacts on bridge infrastructure visually.
   - **Priority:** High
   - **Location:** Section 4.0 Functional Requirements, after requirement 1.8 .

### Use Case

1. **Use Case: View Traffic Data on Map Display**
   - **Goal:** Enable highway information analysts to make informed decisions regarding traffic impacts on bridges.
   - **Actors:** Highway information analysts.
   - **Preconditions:** The user is logged into the system with highway information analyst permissions.
   - **Triggers:** The user selects the option to view traffic data on the map.
   - **Basic Scenario:**
     1. The user navigates to the map display feature.
     2. The user selects the option to overlay traffic data.
     3. The system retrieves current traffic data.
     4. The system overlays traffic data on the map display.
     5. The user analyzes the traffic data in relation to bridge locations and conditions.
   - **Alternative Scenario:** If traffic data is unavailable, display a message indicating the lack of data.
   - **Postconditions:** Traffic data is displayed on the map, enabling analysis.
   - **Location:** Use Case section, after Use Case 4 .

### Non-Functional Requirements

1. **NFR1: Performance**
   - **Description:** The system shall display traffic data on the map within 5 seconds of user request.
   - **Rationale:** To ensure timely access to traffic information for decision-making.
   - **Priority:** High
   - **Location:** Section on Non-functional Requirements.

2. **NFR2: Usability**
   - **Description:** Traffic data overlay on the map must be easily interpretable and distinguishable from other map data.
   - **Rationale:** To ensure that highway information analysts can easily understand and utilize the traffic data.
   - **Priority:** Medium
   - **Location:** Section on Non-functional Requirements.

By placing these requirements in the specified sections of the SRS document, the system's ability to support highway information analysts in making better-informed decisions regarding traffic impacts on bridges will be effectively captured and addressed.
