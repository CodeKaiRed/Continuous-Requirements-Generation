### System Instructions
A software requirements specification is a document containing specifications for a piece of software. It covers the following areas, as specified in bullets:
- Version History
- System Purpose or Objective
- System Description
- Stakeholders or User Classes
- Constraints
- Naming Conventions
- Glossary of Terms
- Assumptions
- Functional Requirements
- Nonfunctional Requirements
- Design Constraints
- Use Cases

A use case highlights the flow of the application to accomplish a goal. The use case format is as follows in bullets:
- Goal
- Actors
- Preconditions
- Triggers
- Basic Scenario (Numbered Sequence for Event Flow)
- Alternative Scenario
- Postconditions

Functional requirements outline what the system will do, while non-functional requirements describe implementation details related to the systemâ€™s functional requirements such as performance, security, safety, reliability, availability, modularity, legality, maintability, portability, supportability, scalability, and/or usability. High-level requirements outline main functionality or a big feature. Low-level requirements outline a set of unique detailed requirements needed to comprehensively realize the high-level requirement it's associated with. All requirements should have a unique numbering system.

A comprehensive set of requirements will extend past the perspective of the software product, user, or stakeholder. A collection (aggregate) of requirements or individual requirements must always meet the following definitions to be achievable, clear, complete, concise, correct, consistent, necessary, organized, unambiguous, and understandable:
- A requirement or an aggregate is achievable/feasible/attainable if and only if there exists at least one system design and implementation that correctly implements the requirement or all the requirements stated in the aggregate at a definable cost. 
- A requirement or an aggregate is clear/precise/meaningful if and only if (a) numeric quantities are used whenever possible, and (b) the appropriate levels of precision are used for all numeric quantities.
- A requirement is complete if it is capable of standing alone when separated from other requirements and does not need further amplification. An aggregate of requirements is complete if and only if (a) It includes all significant requirements, whether relating to functionality, performance, design constraints, attributes, or external interfaces. 
- A requirement or an aggregate is concise if it is as short as possible without adversely affecting any other quality. 
- A requirement is correct if it accurately describes a functionality to be delivered. An aggregate is correct if and only if every requirement stated therein is one that the software shall meet. 
- An aggregate is internally consistent if and only if no subset of individual requirements stated in it conflict. An aggregate is modifiable if and only if its structure and style are such that any changes to the requirements can be made easily, completely, and consistently while retaining the structure and style. 
- A requirement is necessary if the stated requirement is an essential capability, physical characteristic, or quality factor of the product or process. If it is removed or deleted, a deficiency will exist, which cannot be fulfilled by other capabilities of the product or process. 
- An aggregate is organized if and only if its contents are arranged so that readers can easily locate information and logical relationships among adjacent sections are apparent. - A requirement is prioritized/ranked/annotated by relative importance if the requirement is assigned an implementation priority to indicate how essential it is to include it in a particular product. 
- An aggregate is prioritized/ranked/annotated by relative importance if each requirement in it has an identifier to indicate the importance of that particular requirement. 
- A requirement or an aggregate is unambiguous if different readers with similar backgrounds would be able to draw only one interpretation of the requirement or of each requirement in the aggregate. 
- A requirement or an aggregate is understandable if all classes of readers can easily comprehend the meaning of the requirement or all requirements in the aggregate, with a minimum of explanation.

A user story defines an end goal of a software feature written from the perspective of the end user. Its purpose is to articulate how a software feature will provide value to the customer. User stories should be formatted as follows:
"As a a [type of user], I want to [complete some objective], so that I [receive some benefit]."

You are a helpful assistant that translates Pontis user stories into a set of requirement artifacts listed below:
- Functional requirements
- Non-functional requirements
- Use cases
- Operational scenarios
- Constraints

For each user story, create a new set of achievable, clear, complete, concise, correct, consistent, necessary, organized, unambiguous, and understandable requirement artifacts. For each requirement artifact, provide the line number of the output_srs.txt file where the artifact should be placed.

## Final Output from GPT-4-Turbo-Preview
assistant > Based on the user story provided, we'll translate it into a set of requirement artifacts. The user story is:

"As a highway information analyst, I want to see traffic data in the map display so that I can make better decisions for traffic impacts on bridges."

**Functional Requirements:**
1. The system must allow integration of real-time traffic data into the map display.
2. The system must provide an interface for highway information analysts to select specific bridges for which traffic data needs to be displayed.
3. The system must update the traffic data on the map in real-time to ensure the accuracy of information.
4. The system shall enable analysts to filter traffic data based on various parameters such as time of day, traffic volume, and type of vehicles.

**Non-functional Requirements:**
1. Usability: The interface for viewing and interacting with traffic data must be user-friendly and intuitive for highway information analysts.
2. Performance: The map display should load traffic data swiftly and update in real-time without perceptible lag to the user.
3. Reliability: The system must be reliable, ensuring that traffic data is accurate and available 24/7.
4. Scalability: The system must be scalable to accommodate increasing amounts of traffic data and the integration of additional bridges into the map display.

**Use Case:** 
- **Goal:** Display traffic data on the map for decision-making regarding traffic impacts on bridges.
- **Actors:** Highway information analyst.
- **Preconditions:** Traffic data is available and accessible by the system.
- **Triggers:** The highway information analyst selects a bridge or multiple bridges to view traffic data.
- **Basic Scenario:**
  1. The analyst logs into the system.
  2. The analyst selects the 'Traffic Data' option on the map.
  3. The analyst chooses a specific bridge or sets of bridges.
  4. The map updates to display the current traffic information related to the selected bridges.
  5. The analyst reviews the displayed data to make traffic impact decisions.
- **Alternative Scenario:** If traffic data is unavailable, the system displays an error message indicating the issue to the analyst.
- **Postconditions:** The highway information analyst has access to the necessary traffic data on bridges and can make informed decisions.

**Constraints:**
- The system must use existing traffic data sources without requiring significant modifications to the data collection process.
- Integration with map display should comply with geographic information system (GIS) standards for data interchange and visualization.

**Operational Scenarios:**
1. During peak traffic hours, the analyst observes real-time traffic data to make immediate decisions on traffic routing changes.
2. Analysts use historical traffic data to plan long-term projects aimed at reducing traffic impacts on specific bridges.
