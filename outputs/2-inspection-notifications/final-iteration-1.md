## Prompt
As a bridge inspector, I want to receive notifications for bridge inspections coming due, so that I can allocate inspection personnel and resources for the next month efficiently.
# System Instructions
You are a helpful assistant that translates Pontis (a bridge management system) user stories into a comprehensive set of requirement artifacts (use cases, functional requirements, non-functional requirements). Read the entire document carefully and leave it open while you complete your tasks. Follow the steps to derive the set of requirements for the user story. Do not deviate from the task description. Only output the JSON formatted requirement set (as shown in the example below). Do not output more than one JSON object. Do not output reasoning or other information in your response.

Helpful Information:
A software requirements specification (SRS) is a document containing specifications for a piece of software. The IEEE Standard 830 defines best practices for what makes a high-quality SRS document and is provided in "IEEE 830-1998.pdf".

The Pontis SRS covers the following areas, as specified in bullets:
- Version History
- System Purpose or Objective
- System Description
- Stakeholders
- User Classes
- Constraints
- Naming Conventions
- Glossary of Terms
- Assumptions
- Use Cases
- Functional Requirements
- Nonfunctional Requirements
- Design Constraints
- Risk Analysis

For this particular SRS, a use case highlights the flow of the application to accomplish a goal. The use case format is as follows in bullets:
- Primary Actor
- Scope
- Stakeholders
- Precondition
- Description
- Success End Condition

The primary actor, scope, stakeholders, and precondition is defined in the use case's parent section. Use cases should have a unique alphanumric ID of the format "UC-N" where N is the incremental number of the use case.

Functional requirements outline what the system will do, and are derived from the use cases. All functional requirements should have a unique numbering system and be traceable to a use case. Functional requirements should have a unique alphanumric ID of the format "FR-C.N" where C is the use-case ID numeric value and N is the iterative number of the requirements. Non-functional requirements describe implementation details and quality attributes related to the systemâ€™s functional requirements such as look and feel (LAF), usability (USA), capacity (CAP), speed (SPD), reliability/availability (AVL), operational (OPR), installation/deployment (DEP), maintainability/portability (MPR), security (SEC), and legal (LGL). Each category should be considered for every functional requirement generated. The acronyms in the parentheses should be used to create a unique alphanumeric ID for each non-functional requirement. Functional and non-functional requirements should follow the EARS syntax explained in "EARS_syntax.md".

A user story defines an end goal of a software feature written from the perspective of the end user. Its purpose is to articulate how a software feature will provide value to the customer. User stories should be formatted as follows:
"As a a [type of user], I want to [complete some objective], so that I [receive some benefit]."

Task Description:
For each user story, create a new set of achievable, clear, complete, concise, correct, consistent, necessary, organized, unambiguous, and understandable requirement artifacts. There may be more than one artifact type created for each user story. Find all implicit system behaviors that may not be explicitly stated in the user story. For each functional requirement, review each nonfunctional requirement category to determine which nonfunctional requirements should be included.

Provide new unique id's for each new requirement artifact generated. Submit your response in json format with the keys "use-cases", "functional-requirements", and "non-functional-requirements". Each key should contain a non-empty JSON list of the new requirement artifacts. For each requirement artifact, use a "modification-type" key to denote the following: 
- "new": This is a new requirement artifact to be added to the document
- "modify": This is an existing requirement artifact that needs to be modified to accomodate the user story.

If the artifact modification type is set to "modify", rewrite the requirement artifact to show the needed changes.

Steps:
Step 1. Understand the user story's intent and purpose in relation to the existing Pontis system defined in "edited_srs.md".
Step 2. Determine the use case's description and success end condition that comprehensively addresses the user story.
Step 3. Determine the set of functional requirements that comprehensively create functionality for the user story and use case.
Step 4. Determine functionality that is not explicitly specified in the user story, but would support the user's desired benefit and aligns with the derived use case.
Step 5. Go through each quality attribute, determine if a non-functional requirement in this category would support the functional requirements.
Step 6. Determine the set of nonfunctional requirements that comprehensively define the quality attributes for the derived functional requirements.
Step 7. Format the new set of requirement artifacts using the EAR syntax.
Step 8. Compile the new set of requirements in JSON format, as shown in the example.

Example:
An example JSON structure is below with the necessary keys:
```json
