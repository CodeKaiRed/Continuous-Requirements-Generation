The non-functional requirements also enhance the usability and performance of the system, ensuring a user-friendly interface and reliable operation.\n",

      "**Rationale:**\n",
      "The new requirement artifacts accurately describe functionalities that the software shall meet, such as generating notifications for upcoming inspections, allowing inspectors to view due inspections in a calendar view, setting reminders, sending email notifications, and providing summary reports. These functionalities align well with the existing use case for bridge inventory and inspection, ensuring that inspectors are notified of due inspections, which is essential for efficient allocation of inspection personnel and resources. The non-functional requirements also support the functional requirements by ensuring usability, availability, and security. Therefore, the set of requirements is correct and complete according to the IEEE standard for Software Requirements Specification.\n",

      "**Justification:**\n",
      "The new requirements accurately describe functionalities that the software shall meet, such as displaying inspection results on a map with color codes indicating different risk levels, providing a legend for the color codes, and allowing users to filter and view only high-risk bridges. These functionalities align well with the existing structure and goals of the Pontis 5.0 Bridge Management System, ensuring that the requirements are correct and relevant. The non-functional requirements also support the usability and performance of the new functionalities, making the set of requirements comprehensive and correct.\n",

      "**Rationale:**\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **UC-4 Modification**: The modification to UC-4 to include traffic data is a reasonable extension of the existing functionality. However, the success end condition is somewhat vague and does not clearly define what \"traffic data\" entails or how it integrates with the existing bridge and project data.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **FR-4.3**: This new functional requirement states that the system shall show traffic data. While this is a clear requirement, it lacks specificity about what kind of traffic data, its source, and how it will be displayed.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **FR-4.4**: This requirement contradicts the existing functionality of UC-4, which allows users to display a map view. This inconsistency reduces the correctness of the requirement set.\n",

      "The requirement artifacts related to integrating traffic data into the map display for the Pontis Bridge Management System are quite necessary. They enhance the decision-making process by providing additional context about traffic impacts on bridges, which is crucial for effective bridge management and planning. However, while beneficial, the system could still function without this feature, albeit less effectively. Therefore, it scores a 4 for necessity.\n",

      "**Rationale:**\n",
      "The new requirement artifacts related to the notification system for upcoming bridge inspections are essential for the efficient allocation of inspection personnel and resources. Without these functionalities, inspectors may miss critical inspection deadlines, leading to potential safety risks and non-compliance with regulatory requirements. The functionalities such as generating notifications, viewing due inspections in a calendar view, setting reminders, sending email notifications, and providing summary reports are crucial for maintaining an organized and timely inspection process. Additionally, the non-functional requirements ensure the system is user-friendly, reliable, and secure, which are vital for the effective operation of the notification system. Removing these requirements would result in significant deficiencies that cannot be fulfilled by other capabilities of the product.\n",
